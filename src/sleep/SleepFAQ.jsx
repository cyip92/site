        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>What is this page for?</h3>
        People in the world generally wake up and go to sleep once a day. Consistency depends on lifestyle,
        but sleep usually starts during local night time and ends at local morning for most people. This would be
        a 24-hour sleep cycle. I follow a <b>14-hour</b> sleep cycle instead, and this page mainly exists to provide an
        easier way for myself and others to ensure that my sleep pattern does not interfere with any potential plans.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some of you may notice a similarity to <a href="https://xkcd.com/320/">a certain xkcd comic</a>, but that is
        mostly coincidental.


        <h3>How does this sleep pattern work?</h3>
        One of the biggest misconceptions: I do not <i>sleep</i> for 14 hours at a time.
        I am awake for 10 hours and then sleep for 4 hours; this whole <i>cycle</i> repeats a total of every 14 hours.
        By comparison, most people tend towards 17 hours awake and 7 hours asleep, repeating every 24 hours. The broad
        term for this modified cycle is &quot;polyphasic sleep&quot; if you want to look into it more.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since 24 is not divisible by 14, this means that my sleep gets delayed 4 hours later every day. After
        6 days, this adds up to an entire extra day. Thus, a 14-hour cycle still consistently lines up with
        the week. If I am asleep at (for example) 5 AM on a Tuesday in your timezone, then I will always be
        asleep at that time of <i>week</i> for you.
        <br />
        <br />
        This does have the side effect that my sleep does not line up with the day/night cycle <i>anywhere</i> in the
        world. Some days this works out nicely, but other days I end up going to sleep in broad daylight and waking up
        right as everyone around me is heading to sleep.


        <h3>Why did you decide to do this?</h3>
        The 2020 COVID lockdown caused many people&apos;s social lives to shift to being online. At the time
        I was still trying to finish up an advanced degree which mostly involved a lot of independent work in a
        laboratory, so the lack of an in-person social life continued onward for me even as places
        started to open up again. After finishing the degree, I spent the better part of the next year finishing up
        old projects which were also collaborations with others online. My life gradually
        became more weighted towards interacting with people in very widespread time zones.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fast forward to Spring 2022 and I signed a contract for a <a href="https://vertics.co/">software development
        contractor based in Finland</a> through a connection from one of these projects. A few problems
        now arose: the world
        was open enough that a mostly normal pre-COVID life was possible again, I did not want to give up my heavily
        overseas social life, and Finland is 8 hours ahead of my local time zone.
        <br />
        <br />
        With all of those factors, I decided that a shifting sleep cycle would have been the best compromise solution
        for everything - I could able to interact with anyone in anywhere in the world, as long as it is the
        appropriate day of the week. I have been doing this since then, about a year and a half ago.


        <h3>Do you plan to do this for the rest of your life?</h3>
        Definitely not. I will be moving to the UK in early 2024, and plan to be dropping this sleep cycle in favor
        of the more sensible 24-hour cycle everyone else does once I settle in over there.
        The time difference between the UK and Finland being only 2 hours also makes my professional life more
        manageable as well.


        <h3>Are you even getting enough sleep?</h3>
        My 14-hour cycle lets me sleep 12 times over the course of a week, meaning that I get a total of 48 hours
        per week. Averaged out, this is about 6.86 hours per day. This assumes I fall asleep immediately when I am
        supposed to, but I became able to do this through past experiences with polyphasic sleep. I also have
        gotten by with less sleep with some of these previous times as well.


        <h3>Past experience? What other things have you done?</h3>
        I have done heavily modified sleep patterns three times in the past:
        <ul>
          <li>
            My second semester of my Bachelors degree - The dormitory floor I lived on was very close-knit and I wanted
            to spend more time socializing with them, but I generally did not stay up as late as they did. On a whim,
            I decided to give this a try because the dorm was generally quiet in the mid-afternoon due to everyone
            being in class. This was a 12-hour cycle; 8 hours awake and 4 hours asleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            My second-to-last semester of my Bachelors degree - I was taking so many classes at the time to graduate
            within 4 years that I was above the typical limit for credit hours and needed permission to
            register additional classes. Combined with also working through applications for graduate schools,
            I simply needed more time to properly finish all the tasks asked of me. This was an 8-hour
            cycle; 6 hours awake and 2 hours asleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the middle of the 2020 COVID lockdown - I needed to be in our research lab in order
            to adjust electronics and optics, and at the time I still wanted to avoid as much physical
            contact with others as much as feasible. This allowed me to be in the lab at hours which basically
            guaranteed it being empty. This was also an 8-hour cycle (the same 6 awake + 2 asleep).
          </li>
        </ul>
        These were all helpful at the time, but I ultimately decided to return to a 24-hour cycle because as
        useful they were, they also often make you feel very disconnected from the rest of the world.
        In each instance, I held the modified sleep more or less continuously for about 3-4 months.


        <h3>Would you recommend doing this?</h3>
        For the most part, no. Definitely not &quot;just for fun&quot; without some reason or goal in mind.
        <br />
        <br />
        My past experiences with the 8-hour and 12-hour cycles taught me that I was giving
        up 4 hours of daylight time in exchange for 6 hours in the middle of the night. The numbers are
        different for the 14-hour cycle, but the idea is the same - a lot of the time you gain
        is going to be when everyone else is sleeping. It can also be difficult to stay awake in the dead of the night
        without something to keep your brain occupied.
        <br />
        <br />
        The toughest part of polyphasic sleep is the fact that the rest of the world operates on a 24-hour
        cycle. If you want/need to do anything involving people (work, errands, socializing) in your local time zone,
        sleep will regularly get in your way of your plans. I would say that it is only worth modifying your sleep
        to this degree if your lifestyle would benefit from this extra middle-of-the-night waking time and your
        daytime schedule is flexible enough to accomodate the daytime sleep intervals. This is not the case
        for most people out there.


        <h3>I want to do something like this anyway, do you have any tips?</h3>
        First and foremost: There are probably better resources online for advice on how to do this, I am simply
        offering my personal advice and experience here.
        <br />
        <br />
        The first week will be the toughest part by far, do not expect to get a reasonable amount of sleep during that
        time. At least in my experience, if you strictly stick to the new pattern you set for yourself, sooner or later
        your body will realize that you mean business and it needs to get its act together on
        sleeping <i>quickly</i> or else it is not going to get the sleep it needs. Of course everyone&apos;s body is
        different, but I suggest stopping if you cannot get it to work after a week.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once you are on the new sleep pattern, you need to make sure you make a conscious effort to <i>maintain</i> it.
        Everything around you wants you to be on a 24-hour cycle, and you have to ignore all of those external signals
        telling you that. Trick your physiology into thinking it is sleeping properly - use bright
        lighting when awake, wear a sleep mask when sleeping, eat right after waking up to get the energy
        you need to last until your next sleep, etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        People on a 24-hour cycle have the outside world to keep them in line if they stay up late and/or oversleep,
        but you do not and can end up slipping back into a really poor 24-hour cycle. You will need to be strict on
        your wake-up and sleep times, perhaps stricter than you ever have been. This means you will need to sleep
        even if you want to stay up, and you will have to give up on social obligations if they disrupt your cycle.
        The alternative is that you will be struggling to fix your sleep over the next few days and trust me, a messed
        up polyphasic sleep cycle puts you in a way worse spot than simply staying up too late on a 24-hour cycle.
