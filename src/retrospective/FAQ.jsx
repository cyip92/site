        <h1>A Retrospective for The Reality Update</h1>
        <a href="https://ivark.github.io/AntimatterDimensions/">Antimatter Dimensions</a> is an Idle Incremental game
        created by a Finnish developer who goes by the online alias of <b>Hevipelle</b>. It started development in
        2016 and had been under long-term development until the end of 2022, when the final content update (called
        The Reality Update) was released. The game continued to get minor updates until July 2023, at which point it
        was considered to be a complete standalone product.
        <br />
        <br />
        This was by far the largest software project I became involved in, which grew to contain
        a <a href="https://github.com/IvarK/AntimatterDimensionsSourceCode">very large codebase in Vue.js</a> over the
        span of the 7 years it had been developed. As this was largely a passion project, many people who were involved
        came and went as time passed. However, at any given point during my 4.5 year time of working on the game, I
        was working closely and collaboratively with 3-5 other developers and a larger group of 15-25 playtesters on
        the team. I started off as a playtester, but soon began to implement and pull-request minor quality-of-life
        features I wanted to see in the game. Gradually I became more and more involved in the coding end of
        developing the game, until I had effectively become the lead developer of the team a couple years in.
        <br />
        <br />
        For a while, I have been promising people a deep dive into the development of the Reality update. There was
        a lot of post-release activity which kept my time commitment relatively high - fixing incoming bug reports,
        implementing highly-backed user suggestions, and providing a relatively small amount of support for people
        changing the code to make mods for the base game. However, now that things have cooled down and I have had
        the spare time to make this website and start getting all my thoughts on the game organized, I am finally
        getting around to writing everything up.
        <br />
        <br />
        I&apos;m sure you have lots of questions - I&apos;ll try to answer at least the ones which immediately come to
        mind:
        <br />
        <h3>How are you planning to format this retrospective?</h3>
        It will mainly be a series of somewhat short blog-like entries on this site, of likely a similar length to this
        page, which I will post regularly.
        <br />
        <h3>How often do you plan to write these?</h3>
        I&apos;m going to tentatively aim for about once a week, and will post them every Friday in the evening for
        US time zones. I don&apos;t think I can feasibly do more often than that simply because I expect each of these
        to take a somewhat significant amount of time to write.
        <br />
        <h3>Why do you think these will take so long?</h3>
        The history of development is spread across some Discord group chats (in the very beginning), a bunch of
        testing channels (also on Discord), and the history on the Github repo itself. And then after gathering
        information, I&apos;ll need to edit it down to something of a sensible length too.
        <br />
        <h3>Why not some other format, like a video essay or a series of podcasts?</h3>
        If I were to do that, it would probably take way longer to put together, both in total time and per entry.
        I may try to condense it all into something like that once the whole “story” has been told, but otherwise
        this is the format I feel the most comfortable with.
        <br />
        <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
        Two big reasons. The first is that this is something which I&apos;ve had in mind ever since a couple years
        into development and, like many people, I like talking about myself and telling stories I am involved in. The
        second is that after mentioning this offhandedly a few times on Discord, many others have also expressed
        interest in hearing the inside scoop.
        <br />
        <h3>How many entries do you think you&apos;ll write?</h3>
        I have no idea at this point, considering I haven&apos;t written anything past this FAQ so far. The update took
        4.5 years to complete from start to finish, and it definitely wasn&apos;t smooth sailing the entire time. We
        may not have been charging forward with full force the entire time, but there was almost always something going
        on at any given time.
        <br />
        <h3>I have another question which isn&apos;t here!</h3>
        I am still somewhat active on the Antimatter Dimensions Discord server, so you can simply ping me and ask me
        there. Otherwise, the next easiest way would be to send me a DM (<b>@spectralflame</b>). If some question ends
        up being repeatedly asked by multiple people, I&apos;ll come back and update this page again.
        <br />
        <br />
        On the first entry next week, I will dive into the very beginnings of the Reality Update, on June 26th 2018 when
        Hevipelle sent me a message on Discord about testing what was, at the time, a version of the game which barely
        differed at all from the public version of the Time Dilation update.
