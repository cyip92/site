        <h3>What is this page for?</h3>
        My partner enjoys a lot of art-related media in his spare time, in particular the content-creating
        group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Drawfee">Drawfee</a>. Drawfee were originally coworkers under
        College Humor who started making Youtube videos together around 10 years ago, initially focusing on digital
        art but have more recently branched out into other forms of art such as music, woodworking, and game making.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This inspired him to get into making digital art himself. The way he drove himself to do this was by basically
        forcing himself to do a drawing every single day no matter what, starting in November 2023. A bit over a year
        later (December 2024), he has only missed a single-digit number of days of drawing. His art has massively
        improved over time, and only a few months in he received his first commission - to draw someone's original
        D&D character.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Seeing his journey from no prior experience to having actual tangible results made me happy for
        multiple reasons. Most relevantly, it inspired me to want to improve myself in a similar way. So in
        mid-October 2024 I decided to make a similar commitment to myself. I decided that I was going to hold
        myself to some kind of a consistent habit which I could also use as a creative outlet.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I would consider myself to have a passing interest and/or appreciation for most forms of art. In particular
        I have some previous experience in music (4 years of marching band and 3 years of Jazz) and a very
        strong propensity for rhythm games (26 years). However that felt like the easy way out, and amongst my group
        of friends who want to develop games together, we already have a couple other musically-inclined people.
        Considering that, I decided it would be a good idea to throw myself into something completely new and also
        fill in a gap of skills for our team.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My decision was to teach myself how to make 3D models using Blender. In order to stay on track
        and make this more than an empty promise, <b>I committed myself to make <i>something</i> significant in Blender
        by the end of every week, which for this purpose I have considered to be Sunday.</b> This was basically a
        self-assigned "due date" that I would never budge on, and it has done a good job at keeping myself consistent.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And so, that is what this page is about. I will be updating this page weekly on Sundays with whatever I managed
        to put together over the week and a short couple of sentences of my experience with making it, essentially
        chronicling my journey through learning Blender.
